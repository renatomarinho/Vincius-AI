### 1. [YAML-Defined Workflows](#1-yaml-defined-workflows): The Blueprint for Automation

Vincius AI uses simple, human-readable YAML files to define IT workflows. This allows you to easily customize and adapt the system to your specific needs.

#### 1.1 [Agent Configuration](#11-agent-configuration-model-selection-creativity-and-token-control): Model Selection, Creativity, and Token Control

Each agent can be configured to use a different Google Gemini model, allowing you to optimize performance and cost. You can also adjust the agent's creativity with the `temperature` parameter and control token usage with the `max_tokens` parameter.

```yaml
workflow:
  Analysis:
    description: "Analyze and document the requirements for the software."
    responsible_department: ANALYSIS
    action:
      type: class_execution
      class: AnalystAgent
      module: Agents.Analyst.agent
      input_key: null
      output_key: analysis_result
      agent_config:
        model: "gemini-2.0-flash"  # Choose the Gemini model
        max_tokens: 1024           # Limit token usage
        temperature: 0.7           # Adjust creativity (0.0 - 1.0)
```

- `model`: Specifies the Google Gemini model to use (e.g., "gemini-2.0-flash", "gemini-2.0-pro").
- `max_tokens`: Limits the number of tokens the agent can use, helping to control costs.
- `temperature`: Adjusts the agent's creativity. Lower values (e.g., 0.2) produce more predictable results, while higher values (e.g., 0.9) produce more creative and varied results.
