# Technical Requirements Analysis
## Overview
**

The system will be a static website consisting of three HTML pages (Home, Experiences, and About) styled using Tailwind CSS.  The site will be designed to be responsive and visually appealing, adhering to modern web design principles.  Content will be assumed to be personal details suitable for a portfolio or online resume.  Hosting will be assumed to be on a simple static hosting service (e.g., Netlify, GitHub Pages).  The site will prioritize a clean, user-friendly interface.

## Technical Specifications
**

- **Architecture:**
  The architecture will be a simple static website architecture. Each page will be a separate HTML file, linked together through navigation elements in the shared layout component.  There will be no server-side processing or database interaction.  The site will be hosted on a static hosting platform.

- **Technologies:**
  - **HTML5:**  For structuring the content of the website.
  - **Tailwind CSS:** For styling the website and ensuring a modern, responsive design.
  - **JavaScript (Optional):**  May be used for minor interactive elements (e.g., smooth scrolling, simple animations), but is not strictly required for the core functionality.
  - **Node.js and npm (Optional):** Useful for managing Tailwind CSS dependencies and potentially for a development workflow involving build processes.
  - **Static Hosting Platform (e.g., Netlify, GitHub Pages):** To host the website.

- **Security:**
  - **HTTPS:**  The website should be served over HTTPS to ensure secure communication.  This is typically handled by the hosting provider.
  - **Input Validation (Not Applicable):** Since this is a static website with no user input, input validation is not required.
  - **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Consider implementing a CSP to mitigate the risk of XSS attacks, although the risk is low for a static site.

- **Performance:**
  - **Optimized Images:**  Images should be optimized for web use to minimize file
