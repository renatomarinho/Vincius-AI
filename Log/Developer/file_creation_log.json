This includes adding `alt` attributes to images (if any), using semantic HTML elements more effectively, and considering a more structured approach for styling.  Specifically, the `style.css` file is currently empty; moving reusable styles from the HTML to this CSS file improves maintainability.  Also, using a more recent Tailwind version and potentially customizing the config can be beneficial.",
